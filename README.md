# Modified Kaprekar Numbers Algorithm
A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.
Consider a positive whole number n with d digits. We square n to arrive at a number that is either 2*d digits long or (2*d)-1 digits long. Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r. The right hand part, r must be d digits long. The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.
